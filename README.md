# Jukebox Version X support files

The different folders contain the support files for the respective versions of the Jukebox project.

**Attention**
The files are not organized in directories. The student must place them correctly in `port` and `common` folders. Header files `.h` must be placed in `include` and source files `.c` must be placed in `src`.
