# Jukebox Version 1 Test files

This folder contains the test files for unit and integration testing of **Version 1 of the Jukebox** project. You can add more test items on the corresponding files at your own. 

**Attention**
The files are organized in directories. The student must **substitute the `test` folder of the project with this one**. The `test` folder is located in the root of the project. It looks like this:

ğŸ“‚**test**  
 â”£ ğŸ“‚**integration**  
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œCMakeLists.txt  
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‘*test_v1.c*  
 â”£ ğŸ“‚**unit**  
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚**stm32f4**  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œCMakeLists.txt  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‘*test_port_button.c*  
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œCMakeLists.txt  
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‘*test_fsm_button.c*  
 â”— ğŸ“œCMakeLists.txt  

Unit tests are located in the `unit` folder. Integration tests are located in the `integration` folder. The folders also contain the `CMakeLists.txt` files that are used to build the binary files for the `unit` and `integration` codes.

## Unit tests

Unit tests depends on [`unity`](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) library to create the test.

1. **Unit test of the `PORT` part must be run first.** Unit test of the `PORT` part are located in the `unit/stm32f4` folder because the `PORT` module is platform dependent. 

2. **Unit test of the `COMMON` part must be run afterwards.** Unit tests of the `COMMON` part are located in the `unit` folder because the `COMMON` module is platform independent.

## Integration tests

Integration tests does not depend on any library to create the test. It is a small program that tests some features of the system. It is the responsibility of the developer to check if the test is correct or not.

3. **Integration test of the complete `Version` must be run the last.** Integration tests of the each version of the project are located in the `integration`
